         <div class="pg"><p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Malala Yousafzai, the supergirl from Pakistan who was all over the tabloids in the year 2013, for her bold stand against Taliban’s oppression and crusade for girls’ education.
             She was chosen as the ‘Woman of the Year 2013’ by Glamour Magazine and was in the time’s list of “100 Most Influential People in the World” the same year.
             Malala’s impassioned stance on education and women’s rights can be traced to her roots, since her father is an education activist himself. 
             Malala was born on 12th July, 1997 into a Sunni Muslim family in Mingora, Swat district in North-West Pakistan.
              She has two younger brothers. Her father encouraged her to pursue politics and would discuss social issues with her till late at night.
              On her birthday in 2013, observed as ‘Malala Day’, she spoke using the UN platform for education for every child in the world. Currently, she is involved in mobilising support and help for ‘Malala Fund’, which is being raised to help girls come out of poverty and illiteracy.
               She has also actively voiced her concern to bring back the kidnapped girls in Nigeria.She was again nominated in 2014 and this time she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became the youngest person ever to win the nobel prize.
               She was given the honour to open the world’s largest library—the Library of Birmingham.Her name literally means ‘grief-stricken’, but she chose not 
               to lead a life of subjugation and offered a ray of hope to millions of girls like her. She can rightly be called an ‘incarnation of Malalai’, 
               a Pashtun female warrior, whom she is named after. We salute her vision and courage.</p></div>
